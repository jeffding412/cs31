# cs31
These are my solutions to all UCLA CS31 HW/Projects from Fall of 2017. The README.md for each folder contains the project specifications. Please do not try to copy or re-use any of my code for future classes. The purpose of this repository was to back up my work. Now it is a resource for self-education.
