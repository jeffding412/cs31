Prepare your solutions to these homework problems as a single Word document named hw.docx or hw.doc, or a plain text file named hw.txt. Turn in this file as described in the Project 2 specification.

What is the output produced by the following program segment? Don't just run it â€” trace through it and figure it out by hand (which is a skill you'll need for the exams).
	string grendel = "endl";
	cout << "endl";
	cout << grendel;
	cout << endl;
	cout << "grendel";
Consider the following program:
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    int side;

	    cout << "Enter a number: ";
	    cin >> side;

	    for (int i = 0; i < side; i++)
	    {
		for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--)
		{
		    cout << "#";
		}
		cout << "\n";
	    }
	}
In a brief, simple English sentence, state what this program does (e.g. "It prints a map of the Lost Angels County bus system."). Again, figure this out by hand.

Copy the program in problem 2 and change it so that for any input number, the changed program produces exactly the same output as the original, but the changed program uses a while loop instead of a for loop for the inner loop.

Copy the program you wrote for problem 3 and change it so that for any input number, the changed program produces exactly the same output as the original, but uses a do-while loop instead of a for loop for the outer loop. Be careful! (Hint: How does it behave if side is not positive?) You may need to add a little additional code to make sure the program behaves identically to the program in problem 3.

Assume codeSection has been previously declared as an int and given as its value the number of a section of the California Penal Code. Write a switch statement that for any value of codeSection, produces exactly the same output as the following if statement.
	if (codeSection == 281)
		cout << "bigamy";
	else if (codeSection == 321  ||  codeSection == 322)
		cout << "selling illegal lottery tickets";
	else if (codeSection == 383)
		cout << "selling rancid butter";
	else if (codeSection == 598)
		cout << "wounding a bird in a public cemetery";
	else
		cout << "some other crime";
